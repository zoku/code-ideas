# Code Ideas
## Tools
### Library Index
Make a collection of your favourite books.
- Sort them by author, series, IBAN etc.
- Group and sort by meta data (e.g. order of books in a series)

## Games
### Guess a number
- The program generates a number between 1 and 10
- User inputs a number
- The program tells the user if their number is greater, smaller or equal to the generated number
- If the user's number equals the programs number, the game is over

Extra 1: When the user guesses correctly, the program tells them how many tries they needed to do so

Extra 2: When the user guesses correctly, they can start a new round
